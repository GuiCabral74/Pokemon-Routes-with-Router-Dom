## About project

Here i made a project for study using React Router to training pages routes. <br/> In this project the user can navigate in pages of diferents pokemons each one in one diferent page. <br/> I stylized this project with Styled Components, making the project lighter and more easy to build, result in performance gain. 

In this project i used:

* [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to start the project.
* [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) to make the pages routes.
* [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) to stylized the project.
